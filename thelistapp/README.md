***Assignment 2***

**Design and Purpose**

I am a student employee at the Drexel Recreation Center. We currently use a third-party app called **Connect2** to track student employee tasks. I want to build a similar app that is more focused on the actual needs of the Recreation Center and offers a better understanding of the user experience.  

For this assignment, I created a basic **list view** of the app where student employees can **create**, **check**, **uncheck**, and **delete** tasks.

**Target Audience:** Recreation Center staff.

#### **Basic Use**

The app is simple to use. Users can:
- **Create tasks**
- **Delete tasks** if they don’t need them
- Click on a task to mark it as completed
- Use a **“Mark All as Completed”** button to complete all tasks at once
